/**
 * PHP includes all the standard arithmetic operators. For this PHP exercise, you will use them
 * along with variables to print equations to the browser. In your script, create the following variables:
 *
 * $x=10;
 * $y=7;
 *
 * Write code to print out the following:
 *
 * 10 + 7 = 17
 * 10 - 7 = 3
 * 10 * 7 = 70
 * 10 / 7 = 1.4285714285714
 * 10 % 7 = 3
 *
 * Use numbers only in the above variable assignments, not in the echo statements. You will need a third
 * variable as well.
 *
 * Note: this is intended as a simple, beginning exercise, not using arrays or loops.
 * Some of the solutions in comments include these structures. If you don't understand them, just keep
 * learning, and you will.
